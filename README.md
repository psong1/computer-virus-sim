## Problem

Twenty computers are connected in a network. One computer becomes infected with a virus. Every day, this virus spreads from any infected computer to any uninfected computer with probability 0.1. Also, every day, a computer technician takes 5 infected computers at random (or all infected computers, if their number is less than 5) and removes the virus from them. Estimate:

- the expected time it takes to remove the virus from the whole network;
- the probability that each computer gets infected at least once;
- the expected number of computers that get infected.

The situation provides defined values for each parameter, but the program allows the user to change the parameters.

- Drastically increasing/decreasing the number of simulations shows how more/less precise the calculated values become to their true expected values.
